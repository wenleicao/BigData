Write  an  Apache  Pig  query  that  reports  the  Country  Codes  having  number  of  customers  greater  than 5000 or less than 2000

--load customers 
A = LOAD 'customers.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (ID:int, Name:chararray, Age:int, CountryCode:int, Salary:float);

--load transactions
B = LOAD 'transactions.csv' using PigStorage(',') AS (TransID:int, CustID:int, TransTotal:float, TransNumItems:int, TransDesc:chararray);

--group by country codes to count customers
C5=  GROUP A by CountryCode;

--Count  customers
D5 = foreach C5 GENERATE group AS Countrycode , COUNT(A) AS CustomerNumber;

--filter only countryocde with customer number < =2000 or >=5000
E5 = FILTER D5 BY (CustomerNumber <2000) or (CustomerNumber> 5000);

--storage 
STORE E5  INTO 'PIG_Q3.csv' USING PigStorage(',');
